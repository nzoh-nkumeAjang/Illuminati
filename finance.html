      <p>
        The Illuminati is an elite organization of individuals, business moguls, sports professionals, innovators, artists, students, celebrities, leaders and influential members of this planet who cherish the loyalty, patience and the desire to succeed. Our coalition brings together influencers from all political, religious and geographical backgrounds to promote the prosperity of the human species as a whole.
        <br>
        While many of our operations require anonymity for the safety of our members, we strive to create better understanding between ourselves and the people we have been tasked to protect.
        <br>
        Ensuring the survival of more than seven billion humans is an arduous task. Our duty to this planet spans centuries and has survived even the most established governmental entities. To continue operating through societal and generational changes, Illuminati operations often require the anonymity of our members and our work.
        <br>
        The Illuminati have aided in every major movement on this planet since the creation of the first human government. Our work is often marked with distinct symbols to trace our influence through history for those who wish to investigate.
        <br>
        With the gentle guidance of our organization, the human species is allowed to function in its natural order while acting as cogs in a machine for the betterment of the world. We want prosperity and universal peace to prevail.
        <br>
        No! The goal of the Illuminati is the preservation of the human species. Therefore, any evil practice that does NOT serve the betterment of humanity would go against everything we stand for and is therefore prohibited under all circumstances. While many have attributed such actions to our members, these connections are only based on rumors.
