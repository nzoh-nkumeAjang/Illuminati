        <h3>The light</h3>
        <p>
          Points toward the Light, revealing truth and direction when facing decisions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Given many names by spiritual leaders and unexplainable by science, 
          the Light is an invisible guide that many believe has led them to joy, success, 
          and lives of Abundance. It communicates directly to every human, urging them to strive 
          for goodness and forgo their natural selfishness.
          All human religions and spiritual beliefs ultimately seek the 
          Light in ways differing only in form and function.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some religions refer to the Light with a name, such as God or Elohim. 
          The core of every religion is founded on the human species’ innate desire to 
          understand this invisible force. Even without a formal religious affiliation, 
          every human is naturally drawn to the Light. Individual members of the Illuminati 
          adhere to every variety of personal spiritual beliefs –– but by recognizing that all of 
          our paths lead to the same destination, we find that the Light brings all people into an ultimate unity.
          There is no proof that a God exists but there is also no proof that a God does not.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Illuminati’s spiritual foundation is based upon this universal conundrum of 
          faith and doubt. Our organization does not question whether a god does or does not 
          exist but instead focuses on the betterment of the humans living on this planet.

          We Are Always Watching Out For You
          The human species is guarded and preserved by a coalition of its most elite members called the Illuminati.
          Since our origination, Illuminati members have guided Earth’s most dominant 
          creature through periods of interpersonal chaos, environmental outbreaks, and 
          other mass attacks that threaten humanity with extinction.
          <br>
          <br>
          The human has made itself this planet’s most dominant and advanced species. Even 
          the weakest human is born master of the strongest of all other species on Earth. Through 
          natural selection, every human generation is made of a genetic structure that is stronger and 
          more advanced than the previous.
          Living humans evolve at a rapid pace, and can continue to advance in ability through 
          study, practice, and a commitment to self-improvement.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Illuminati is made of individuals who have reached this Awakening. Leaders, 
          innovators, and other influential members of this planet have joined together to shape 
          the face of human society and guide its masses into finding their own individual place in the Universal Design.
          To create a better world, unique beings with unique objectives and beliefs must forgo 
          their differences and work together for the good of all.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is the Illuminati’s responsibility to ensure the ongoing survival and advancement of 
          the human species, so that all people, in all places, can live in Abundance.

        <h3>The pyramid</h3>
        <p>
          In popular culture, a great amount of focus is placed on the Illuminati’s 
          belief that money is not evil. Some view our encouragement of work and wealth as a 
          promotion of selfishness – overlooking the true meaning of the Pyramid and its 
          underlying messages that motivate our diligence.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the tenets of the Illuminati, wealth is not simply a means of personal enrichment. 
          Instead, money is a tool that can be used to fulfill each person’s duty to the advancement 
          of the human species.
          The selfish pursuit of money is a hollow goal, but the pursuit of the best that money 
          can create is one of humanity’s greatest responsibilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          The more money a person owns, the more ability they have to positively change the lives of 
          those who are in need. If you are poor and of good heart, and your friend’s house is burned 
          in a fire, you will remain a good person but have no ability to help them with what they need 
          the most. If the same house burns but you are rich, you can give your friend a place to stay 
          and a new home because you have more than enough for yourself and anyone around you who needs it.
          Money has no feeling, no voice, and no soul – its choice between good or evil is decided by those who use it.
